# motive-chess
Project space for me to play around with various chess programming ideas

There's every chance this will never amount to anything other than a sandbox for me to play with things, but that's OK.

Stuff in here will be my own, but taking ideas and suggestions from wherever this journey takes me.

## Project outline
A simple chess engine, probably UCI-based, and maybe some supporting utilities

Areas to experiment:
 * bitboards and 0x88 for move generation and/or evaluation
 * alpha/beta with minmax or some sort of negmax and pruning
 * some simplistic off-the-rack board eval
 * multi-threading
